There is a number of approaches for reviewing status of the project: The Internet allows us to communicate with your as easily as if we werenext door.We will provide you with regular status reports based on time sheets from our developers. Regular updates of the schedule with specified current status provides upper level view to the state of project. Once again the most convenient ways are E-mail, ICQ, MSN messenger, Netmeeting. Lots of tools allow you to talk directly to your programmer team in real time. It is also possible to appoint a team leader, if you prefer to have a single point of contact. Based on reviewing these status artifacts you may propose changes to the project process, features, etc.
